We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 26:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. I think I got them all! Next, I summarized what to expect from the course, toured the the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat232f19/">course webpage</a>, and summarized a few items on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat232f19/syllabus/">syllabus</a>. With the time we had left, I split the class up into small groups and them work on a few variations of the mind-swapping problem from the TV show Futurama.  Great first day.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 28:</b> First day of student presentations went great! After discussing questions on the syllabus, we divided the class up into several small groups.  Each groups was tasked with coming to consensus on a proposed solution to one of the assigned homework problems.  We had BM/DE, DW, and MR present Problems 4, 3, 2, respectively.  We'll get caught up on Problem 1 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 30:</b> After discussing the upcoming homework, we jumped into student presentations.  We had CS, HT, and MR present Problems 1, 5, and 6, respectively.  I'm really happy with how things are going.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 2:</b> Labor Day, no class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 4:</b> Today was one of those days where I was reminded how awesome my job is.  We kicked off by discussing the videos on grit and growth mindset I asked the students to watch.  Perhaps I ran my mouth too much, but we had a nice discussion nonetheless.  After discussing the videos, I asked the class to split up into groups of size 2-3.  The intention was for people to work with people they hadn't interacted with much yet.  Each group was tasked with discussing at least two parts of Problem 7 (soul swapping).  We had DM/AS and TB present parts (a) and (b), respectively.  It was nice to see a variety of approaches to notation.  We'll catch up on parts (c) and (d) next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 6:</b> Another action-packed day. After discussing the upcoming quiz, we had BM and AL present parts (c) and (d) from Problem 7, which were left over from last time. I then spent a little bit of time discussing the big picture of the Futurama Theorem. This was followed by discussion about Problem 8 that was led by AC and MB. We wrapped with a quick presentation for Problem 10(a) by LF. We'll catch up on Problem 9 and the rest of Problem 10 next week.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 9:</b> The students took Quiz 1.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 11:</b> I felt like we accomplished a lot today. We spent some time reviewing the solution to Problem 10(a) and then had CM, WE, TY, and SE present Problems 10(b), 10(c), 11, and 12, respectively. All of these problems had the same theme. With the few minutes we had left, VS did a quick run down of his approach to Problem 9. We'll revisit this one on Friday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 13:</b> I think I ran my mouth too much today. After reviewing the big picture for Problems 13-15, we divided the class up into 5 small groups. After letting each group chat about their assigned problem for several minutes, we had CP, VS, DM, DB, and MB present Problems 13, 14(b), 14(c), 14(d), and 15, respectively.  We still need to find time to revisit Problem 9.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 16:</b> Today was mostly about catching up and reviewing previous problems.  We spent some time discussing Problem 9 and then AC presented Problem 17. This was followed by revisiting Problems 14 and 15. We will catch up on Problem 16 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 18:</b> We covered a lot of problems today! We had SS, VM, JL, TR, SC, DB, DE, LF, AL, AS, CS, HT/TB, DT present Problems 16(a), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), 20, 21(a), 21(b), 21(c), 21(d), and 21(e), respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 20:</b> After revisiting Problem 21(d), we had DT/JL, CS, and CP present Problems 18, 22, and 23, respectively. We will likely revisit Problem 22 since we were a bit rushed at the end of class.</li>
</ul>

## Week 5 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 23:</b> The students took Quiz 2.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 25:</b> We started off by revisiting Problem 22 (ants on a stick) and then split the class up into a few small groups.  We had SE, SS, WE, SC, and TR present Problems 24(a), 24(b), 24(c), 25, and 26, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 27:</b> We had DE, TY, and JL present Problems 27, 28, and 29, respectively. With the few minutes we had left at the end, we quickly discussed what "visual proof" means.</li>
</ul>

## Week 6 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 30:</b> I spent the first few minutes summarizing solutions to the problems on part B of Quiz 2. Next, we divided the class up into several small groups.  We had MB and BM present Problems 30 and 31, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, October 2:</b> The first ten minutes or so were devoted to discussing the big picture of axiomatic systems and giving an introduction to Circle-Dot. Next, we had LF, DM, AL, CP, and DW present Problems 32(algebra), 32(visual), 33, 34, and 35, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, October 4:</b> Coming soon.</li>
</ul>
