We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 26:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. I think I got them all! Next, I summarized what to expect from the course, toured the the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f19/">course webpage</a>, and summarized a few items on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f19/syllabus/">syllabus</a>. With the time we had left, I split the class up into small groups and them work on a few variations of the mind-swapping problem from the TV show Futurama.  Great first day.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 28:</b> Absolutely fantastic first day of student presentations.  After discussing questions on the syllabus, we divided the class up into several small groups.  Each groups was tasked with coming to consensus on a proposed solution to one of the assigned homework problems.  We had JH, KG, YT, AL, and AH present Problems 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, respectively.  We'll get caught up on Problems 2.6-2.11 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 30:</b> After briefly discussing LaTeX and the first Weekly Homework assignment, we jumped into presentations.  We had AR, JC, YC, and MK present Problems 2.7, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.12, respectively.  Along the way, I presented Problems 2.6, 2.8, and 2.11.  We will attempt to get caught up on Problems 2.13 and 2.14 next time.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 2:</b> Labor Day, no class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 4:</b> Fun day of class today.  We kicked off with a brief discussion of LaTeX and then jumped into student presentations.  We had DT, BS, HA, HL, AR, and CM present Problems 2.13(a), 2.13(b), 2.13(c), 2.14, 2.20(a), and 2.20(b), respectively.  Along the way, we also discussed Problems 2.17-2.19 and ended with a class discussion of Problem 2.21.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 6:</b> Busy day, but we managed to get through almost everything that was planned.  We had TN, SB, and MG present Problems 2.22, 2.23, and 2.26, respectively.  Along the way, we also discussed Problems 2.24 and 2.27.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 9:</b> I haven't done a good job of keeping us on schedule or picking the correct number of problems for homework.  Hopefully, we'll get on track soon. Nonetheless, I think things are going well.  I kicked off today by discussing the axioms of a group. Next, we had SW, DC, and BS present Theorem 2.29, Problem 2.31(a), and Problem 2.38, respectively.  Along the way, we discussed Problems 2.32-2.36. We will catch up on Theorems 2.37 and 2.39 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 11:</b> After reviewing the axioms of a group, we discussed a few key ideas related to the recent proofs.  We had RH, CM, and AA present proofs for Theorems 2.37, 2.39, and 2.45, respectively.  We also discussed Problem 2.40. The goal is to tackle Theorems 2.41-2.44 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 13:</b> We are making progress and I think the students are feeling much more comfortable with writing proofs, but we're still a bit behind where I'd like to be. After dividing the class up into small groups, we had HL, MG, and JT present Theorems 2.41, 2.42, and 2.44, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 16:</b> Lots of awesome stuff happened today.  Things are coming together! We had BS and SW present proofs for Theorem 2.48(a) and Theorem 2.51. Along the way, we discussed the proof of Theorem 2.48(b) and rehashed Theorem 2.51.  In addition, we tackled Problem 2.49.</li>
