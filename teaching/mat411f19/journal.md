We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 26:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. I think I got them all! Next, I summarized what to expect from the course, toured the the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f19/">course webpage</a>, and summarized a few items on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f19/syllabus/">syllabus</a>. With the time we had left, I split the class up into small groups and them work on a few variations of the mind-swapping problem from the TV show Futurama.  Great first day.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 28:</b> Absolutely fantastic first day of student presentations.  After discussing questions on the syllabus, we divided the class up into several small groups.  Each groups was tasked with coming to consensus on a proposed solution to one of the assigned homework problems.  We had JH, KG, YT, AL, and AH present Problems 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, respectively.  We'll get caught up on Problems 2.6-2.11 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 30:</b> After briefly discussing LaTeX and the first Weekly Homework assignment, we jumped into presentations.  We had AR, JC, YC, and MK present Problems 2.7, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.12, respectively.  Along the way, I presented Problems 2.6, 2.8, and 2.11.  We will attempt to get caught up on Problems 2.13 and 2.14 next time.</li>
</ul>

  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 4:</b> Fun day of class today.  We kicked off with a brief discussion of LaTeX and then jumped into student presentations.
