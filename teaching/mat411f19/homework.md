## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments with no questions asked**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf).

## Daily Homework ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  During class, **you are only allowed and encouraged to annotate your homework using the colored marker pens that I provide**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f19/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, August 28)
- **Daily Homework 2:** Read and sign the [Student Contract]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/StudentContract.pdf). (Due Wednesday, August 28)
- **Daily Homework 3:** Read all of [Chapter 1: Introduction]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411s18/Introduction.pdf) of the course notes.  In addition, complete 2.1-2.11 in [Chapter 2: An Introduction to Groups]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f19/IntroGroups.pdf) and digest the surrounding text along the way. (Due Wednesday, August 28)
- **Daily Homework 4:** Stop by my office (AMB 176) and say hello. If I'm not there, just slide note under my door saying you stopped by. (Due by 5PM on Friday, August 30)

## Weekly Homework ##
For most of the assignments below, you will be required to submit 2-3 formally written proofs. You are required to type your submission using LaTeX (see below).  You can either submit a hardcopy of your assignment or email me the PDF of your completed work. If you email me the PDF, please name your file as <code>WeeklyX-LastName.pdf</code>, where <code>X</code> is the number of the assignment and <code>LastName</code> is your last name.  Notice there are no spaces in the filename.

- **Weekly Homework 1:** Read <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids1/">The Secret to Raising Smart Kids</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck/">Carol Dweck</a> and <a href="https://www.turnaroundusa.org/7-things-growth-mindset-is-not/">7 Things Growth Mindset is Not</a>. Write a one-page summary/reflection about the article. For this assignment, I suggest you use the template on <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> found <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/weekly-homework-1-for-reflection-on-the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids/wsqscmkyzrsr">here</a> instead of using the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Tuesday, September 3 by 8PM)

## Using LaTeX for Weekly Homework ##
You are required to use LaTeX to type up your Weekly Homework assignments. The easiest way to get started with LaTeX is to use an online editor.  I recommend using [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), but there are other options.  The good folks over at Overleaf have preloaded my homework template, so to get started, all you need to do is click the link below and then click on "Open as Template". Be sure to update your name and the course title.
