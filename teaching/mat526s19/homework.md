## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments with no questions asked**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf).

## Daily Homework ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  During class, **you are only allowed and encouraged to annotate your homework using the colored marker pens that I provide**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat526s19/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, January 16)
