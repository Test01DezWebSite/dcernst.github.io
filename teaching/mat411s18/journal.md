We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 15:</b> Martin Luther King Jr. Day, no classes.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 17:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. Next, I summarized what to expect from the course, toured the the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411s18/">course webpage</a>, and summarized a few items on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411s18/syllabus/">syllabus</a>. With the time we had left, we briefly tinkered with Spinpossible.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 19:</b> I think we had a great second day! After fielding a few questions about the syllabus and reminding students about the day-to-day structure, we divided the class up into 10 small groups, each tasked with discussing one of the homework problems.  We had RF, RD, SJ, JB, VM, ER, and HH presented their proposed solutions to Problems 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, and 2.8, respectively. Along the way I presented a solution to Problem 2.6.  We will wrap up Problems 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 22:</b> Another great day! We had AS, ML, SJ, JW, QC, LD, and MD present Problems 2.10, 2.11, 2.12/2.14, 2.13(a), 2.13(b), 2.14(c), 2.14, and 2.17, respectively.  Along the way, I presented Problems 2.9, 2.18, and 2.19. We had 2 minutes at the end to discuss Weekly Homework 1 and do a quick introduction to LaTeX.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 24:</b> After a quick summary of what a group is, we jumped into student presentations.  We had TC, ER, JC, AM, JW, FA, and AT present Problems 2.20(a), 2.21(a), 2.22(a), 2.23(a), 2.24, 2.26(a), and 2.26(b), respectively.  Along the way, I discussed part (b) for 2.20-2.23. We discussed LaTeX briefly in the last few minutes of class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 26:</b> We accomplished a lot today.  Most presenters were chosen in advance.  We had MM, ML, MS, AS, FZ, BH, and LD present Problem 2.27, Problem 2.28, Theorem 2.29, Problem 2.31, Problem 2.32, Problem 2.34, and Theorem 2.37, respectively.  Along the way, I covered Problems 2.35 and 2.36.</li>
</ul>


## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 29:</b> After reviewing Problems 2.35, 2.36, and 2.38, we spent 10 minutes discussing LaTeX.  Next, I somewhat sloppily divided the class up into 5 small groups, each tasked with discussing one of the homework problems.  After a few minutes, we had CW, JB, MS, and RF present Theorem 2.39, Problem 2.40, Corollary 2.41, and Theorem 2.42, respectively.  We will discuss Theorem 2.43 on Wednesday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 31:</b> Even though we didn't get to all the problems today, I feel like we covered a tremendous amount of content.  We had JC, DS, RH, GT, DC, and JS present Theorem 2.43 (which as left over from Monday), Theorem 2.44, Theorem 2.45, Theorem 2.47(a), Theorem 2.47(b), and Problem 2.48, respectively. Theorem 2.50 and Problems 2.53-2.55 will likely get discussed on Friday when Dr. Falk covers for me.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, February 2:</b> Dr. Falk covered for me while I was out of town.  My understanding is that Dr. Falk covered Theorem 2.50, Problem 2.53, and Problem 2.54. Along the way, there was also some discussion of the free group on one letter and the free group on two letters.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

## Week 8 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, March 5:</b> We tried to get caught up today, but we are still a bit behind.
