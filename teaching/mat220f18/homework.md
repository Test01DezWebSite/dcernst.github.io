## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments with no questions asked**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf) as a reference.

## Homework ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  During class, **you are only allowed and encouraged to annotate your homework using the colored marker pens that I provide**.

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-edit"></i><b>Homework 1:</b> Read the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f18/syllabus/">syllabus</a> and write down 5 important items.  <i>Note:</i>  All of the quiz dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, August 29)</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-edit"></i><b>Homework 2:</b> Stop by my office (AMB 176) and say hello. If I'm not there, just slide a note under my door saying you stopped by. (Due by 5PM on Friday, August 31)</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-edit"></i><b>Homework 3:</b> Complete Problems 3-5 from the <a href="https://dcernst.github.io/teaching/mat220f18/220ProblemCollection.pdf">Problem Collection</a>. (Due Wednesday, August 29)</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-edit"></i><b>Homework 4:</b> Complete Problems 6-9 from the <a href="https://dcernst.github.io/teaching/mat220f18/220ProblemCollection.pdf">Problem Collection</a>. In addition, watch "Grit: the power of passion and perseverance" and any other 4 videos listed under Growth Mindset and Productive Failure on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f18/materials/">Course Materials</a> page and then write a reflection that is at least 15 sentences long. You should comment on each of the videos you watched, but rather than reflecting on each video separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, productive failure, and grit, in general. You are required to type your reflection. (Due Friday, August 31)</li>
