We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.
</p>

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 27:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. I think I got them all! Next, I summarized what to expect from the course, toured the the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f18/">course webpage</a>, and summarized a few items on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f18/syllabus/">syllabus</a>. With the time we had left, we discussed Problem 1 from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f18/220ProblemCollection.pdf">Problem Collection</a>. ZK, NZ, and WS volunteered to discuss their approaches to Problem 1.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 29:</b> We had a great second day! After fielding a few questions about the syllabus and reminding students about the day-to-day structure, we divided the class up into 8 small groups, each tasked with discussing one of the homework problems.  We had ST/JT, ER/JS, JJ/AP, RH presented their proposed solutions to Problems 2, 3, 5(b), and 5(c) respectively. We will wrap up Problems 4 and 5(a) on Friday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 31:</b> We spent the first 10-15 minutes discussing growth vs fixed mindset, grit, and productive failure.  Next, we had GM, HO, WC, and JM present Problems 5(a), 6, 7, and 4, respectively.  I think we will revisit Problem 4 (Sunny Day Juice Stand) to make sure everyone is up to speed and to see alternate approaches.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 3:</b> Labor Day! No classes.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 5:</b> We kicked off with some discussion of the upcoming quiz and then I revisited Problem 4 (Sunny Day Juice Stand).  Next we had CB, CC, and BC present Problems 8, 9, and 11.  We ran out of time for a thorough discussion of Problem 10, so we will come back to that one next week.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 7:</b> The students took Quiz 1.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 10:</b> After a little chit chat, we split the class up into 8 small groups, where each group was tasked with coming to consensus on two of the assigned problems.  After some time, we had AP, SW, RH, and JJ present Problems 10, 12, 13, and 14, respectively.  We didn't quite have enough time to do Problem 14 justice, so we will revisit this one next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 12:</b> After handing back Quiz 1, I revisited Problems 4 and 14. Nex, we jumped into presentations.  We had KW, KN, YF, JH, JJ, NZ, DH, SK, WC, and JM present Problems 15(a), 15(b), 15(c), 16, 17(a), 17(b), 17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and 18, respectively.  Dang, we covered a lot.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 14:</b> We had JH, KW, DH, CC, AP, and RH volunteer to present Problems 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), 20, 21, and 22, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 17:</b> I'm not sure everyone was as entertained as I was today. I really enjoyed the conversation.  We had CC/WC/YF, KN, ER/ZK, and HO/ZK present Problems 23, 24, 25, and 26, respectively.  As expected, Problems 23 and 26 generated some passionate discussion.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 19:</b> We devoted the first few minutes to making sure everyone was up to speed on the problems we were about to discuss.  Then we briefly revisited Problem 26.  Next, we split the class up into several small groups, each tasked with discussing two of the day's problems.  After a few minutes, we had AS, YF, SK, and ST present Problems 29, 30(visual), 30(algebraic), and 27, respectively.  With the few minutes we had left, I very quickly summarized Problem 28.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 21:</b> The students took Quiz 2.</li>
</ul>

## Week 5 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 24:</b> We spent a few minutes revisiting Problem 28 and then we divided into small groups.  We had SK/JJ, WC/YF, and CB present their proposed solutions to Problems 31, 32, and 33, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 26:</b> Lots of cool stuff happened today.  We had CB, HO, BC/ST, and NZ present Problems 34(algebraic), 34(visual), 35, and 36, respectivley.  Typically, no one comes up with a solution for the visual proof for Problem 34, but HO pretty much had it. Also, rarely does anyone have a complete solution for Problem 36, but NZ nailed it.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 28:</b> After handing back Quiz 2, we spent some time discussing solutions to Problems B1 and B2 from the quiz. Next, we had JS/WC and GC/ER present Problems 37 and 38, respectively.  We ran out of time for Problem 39, so we will kick off with that one next time.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, October 1:</b> We had GC/ZK/RH, JH, and HO/WC present Problems 39, 40, and 41, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, October 3:</b> After revisiting Problem 39, NZ presented an alternative solution to Problem 41 and then we agreed that his solution could also be made to work for Problem 40.  Next, we had JM and AS present Problems 42 and 43, respectively.  With the few minutes we had left, we briefly discussed the next two problems.</li>

  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, October 15:</b> We divided the class up into six small groups and each group was tasked with writing up at least two of the problems that were due today.
