We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 13:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. I think I got them all! Next, I summarized what to expect from the course, toured the the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320s20/">course webpage</a>, and summarized a few items on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320s20/syllabus/">syllabus</a>. With the time we had left, we started discussing some of the content due on Wednesday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 15:</b> Unfortunately, I missed today due to being at a conference. Zach Parker covered for me while I was away. JJ, SS, FB, YF, AS, and ID presented Theorem 2.3, Theorem 2.4, Problem 2.5, Problem 2.7, Problem 2.8, and Problem 2.9, respectively.  That's a lot of student presentations!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 17:</b> Zach covered for me again while I was gone.  IS, KB, NH, and JG presented Problem 2.12, Problem 2.13, Theorem 2.14, and Corollary 2.15, respectively. Next week, We will catch up on the ones that were not presented.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 20:</b> MLK Day, no classes.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 22:</b> Today was all about recalibrating after me being gone most of last week. After some discussion of course expectations, we briefly discussed the use of LaTeX for the Weekly Homework assignments.  Next, we had CH and AL present Problem 2.16 and Theorem 2.17, respectively.  The proof of Theorem 2.17 generated lots of great discussion.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 24:</b> Awesome day!  We kicked off with presentations of Theorem 2.18 and Problem 2.19 by HG and JH.  Next, we split the class up into several small groups, each tasked with discussing one of 2.20-2.23. After some time, we had LC/FB, PC, and RT present Theorem 2.20, Problem 2.21, and Theorem 2.22, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 27:</b> I spent way too long discussing LaTeX, but hopefully it was helpful.  Our only presentation of the day was of Theorem 2.23 by TF. With the time left, we discussed Exercise 2.25.  We will play catch up on Wednesday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 29:</b> After a short discussion of growth mindset and grit, we had RB, RP, NC, JD, SR, and AL present Exercise 2.30, Exercise 2.33, Problem 2.34, Theorem 2.36, Theorem 2.37, and Problem 2.38, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 31:</b> Fantastic day!  Lots of ideas were synthesized.  After a brief discussion of contrapositives and proof by contradiction, I split the class up into groups of size 2-3.  Lots of great discussion! We had DW, GI, FB, and HG present Theorem 2.46, Problem 2.48, Theorem 2.49, and Theorem 2.50, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, February 3:</b> Prior to the beginning of class, I wrote some stuff on the board for Theorem 2.52 and Exercise 2.54.  Next, we had NC, KB, LC, and PC present Corollary 2.53, Exercise 2.55, Theorem 2.57, and Exercise 2.58, respectively. With the time we had left, I discussed the big picture of proof by contradiction.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, February 5:</b> After some short discussion of the upcoming exam, we had IS and RP present Theorems 2.61 and 2.62.  Both of these generated excellent discussion!  With the time we had left, we discussed Exercises 2.63 and 2.64 as a class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, February 7:</b> Prior to the beginning of class, I wrote solutions for Exercises 2.67 and 2.72 on the board.
